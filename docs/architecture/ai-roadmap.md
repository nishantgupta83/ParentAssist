# AI Roadmap (Post MVP-1)

## MVP-2
- Auto-Incident Classifier: NLP tags errors (network drop, permission denied, TURN fail)
- Quality Predictor: Uses FPS/latency/packet-loss to warn of impending drop

## MVP-3
- Sensitive App Classifier: ML model flags new/unknown sensitive apps
- Guided Steps Generator: On-device CV suggests steps if helper offline
- Voice Command Understanding: Map senior speech to intents/actions

## Telemetry (for models)
- Session metrics: fps, bitrate, RTT, packet loss, P2P/relay
- Error codes with timestamps
- Device/network metadata (coarse, privacy-preserving)
